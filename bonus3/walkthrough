In the source file we can see that the programe fill a buffer with the content of the pass file.
Then it put a '\0' in this buffer at the index give by the atoi of the argument give to the programe.
Finaly it compar the buffer with the argument and if they are identique it exec a shell.

But if we send a empty string the atoi will return 0 and the buffer will start with a null character so be an empty string like the argument we just passe.
Then we got the shell

./bonus3 ""
