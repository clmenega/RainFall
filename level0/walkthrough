We found a binary in the home directory executed as level1
It segfaults withtout any argument and say 'No !' otherwise.

We unscessfully tried to decompile the binary. So we started to use gdb.
With gdb, we can see that the first function call is ``atoi()`` and its
return value is compared to ``0x1A7`` or ``423`` in decimal.
When we try to run ``./level0 423`` we got access to a shell logged as level1.
We can get the level1 flag. ``cat /home/user/level1/.pass``
