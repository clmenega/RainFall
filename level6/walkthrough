We saw a n function that give us our flag. This n function is never called.
So we need to find a way to call it.

In the main function, there are 2 mallocs.
The first one is a buffer, the second one is a function pointer.
The function pointer is initilized with m function address.
The buffer is filled with argv[1].

buf ptr addr = 0x804a008
fn ptr addr  = 0x804a050

In the heap, we can see that both alloced variables are following.
So if we overflow the buffer enough, it will overwrite the function pointer.

```
./level6 $(perl -e 'print "A"x64 . "B"x8 . "\x54\x84\x04\x08"')
```
