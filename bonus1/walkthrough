In this programe we can see in the source code that the program takes two arguments, one that define the number and a second as a string.

We can see that the first argument will be use in a atoi function to be store in a int.
Then if the previous int is inferor to 10 four time this int of data will be copy from the second argument into the buffer.
Then if the num is equal to 0x574f4c46 a shell is prompt.

The idea is to overwrite the num with the buffer before in the memory.
If the is of 40 and the num must be inferior to 10 so the overflow look impossible. 

But if we use a negative int the memcpy will use this number. We need the copy of 44 char to overwrite num so we need a num of 11. 
So we will remove 11 (0xb) to the int min -2147483648(0x80000000) to get -2147483637(0x7FFFFFF5)
Then we fill the buffer with "B" and write the mumber expected.

./bonus1 -2147483637 $(python -c 'print "B" * 40 + "\x46\x4c\x4f\x57"')
