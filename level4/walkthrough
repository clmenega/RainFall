This is the same as previous level.

In the source file, we can see a global variable `m`. If this global variable is
the number 0x0x1025544 or 16930116, we got the level5 password.
So we need to be able to change the value of m. A global variable is always
initialized at 0.

Since a global variable is in the Data section of the binary. We can not
overwrite this section.

Another approach would be to exploit the `printf()` function in the line
preceding the check.

Since we can write `printf()` format, we can overwrite the `m` global variable
value. For that, we need to find it's address.

m address: 0x8049810

Now that we have it's address, we can use the `printf()` flag `%n` to write the
good value.

```python
#! /usr/bin/env python

M_ADDR          = "\x10\x98\x04\x08"
PAD             = "%x "*10
OVERWRITE       = "%16930041x %n "

print M_ADDR + PAD + OVERWRITE
```
